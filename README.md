# Student Performance Analysis (Python & Pandas)

This project analyzes student academic performance using core Python and the Pandas library.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate basic data analysis techniques on student performance data. The project includes both a pure Python implementation and a Pandas-based implementation.

## Features
- Reads student data from a CSV file
- Calculates total and average marks
- Assigns grades based on performance
- Evaluates attendance status
- Calculates class average
- Identifies class topper
- Demonstrates both list-based and Pandas-based approaches
